            You know how every year the medical community campaigns for everyone to get a flu shot?
            That’s because flu outbreaks typically have a season—a time of year when they start
            spreading and infecting people.
          <br><br>
            In contrast, there are no predictable seasonal infections for PCs, smartphones, tablets,
            and enterprise networks. For them, it’s always flu season. But instead of suffering chills
            and body aches, users can fall ill from a kind of machine malady—malware.
            Each type of malware infection has its own methods of attack—from stealthy and sneaky to
            subtle like a sledgehammer. But if knowledge is power, as a preventative inoculation against
            infection, we offer here a short cybersecurity course on malware, what it is, its symptoms,
            how you get it, how to deal with it, and how to avoid it in the future.

            <h1 class="subsubtitle"> <i> <u> Malware definition </u></i></h1>

            <p class="text2">
              Malware, or “malicious software,” is an umbrella term that describes
              any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems. Hostile,
              intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage,
              or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and
              mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device’s
              operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning.<br><br>
              The motives behind malware vary. Malware can be about making money
              off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political
              statement, or just bragging rights. Although malware cannot damage
              the physical hardware of systems or network equipment (with one known
              exception—see the Google Android section below), it can steal,
              encrypt, or delete your data, alter or hijack core computer functions,
               and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or
               permission.

                <h1 class="subsubtitle"> <i> <u> The way of spreading of Malware</u></i></h1>

           <p class="text2">
                  The two most common ways that malware accesses your system are
                  the Internet and email. So basically, anytime you’re connected
                  online, you’re vulnerable.
                  Malware can penetrate your computer when (deep breath now) you surf
                  through hacked websites, view a legitimate site serving malicious
                  ads, download infected files, install programs or apps from unfamiliar
                  provide, open a malicious email attachment (malspam), or pretty much
                  everything else you download from the web on to a device that lacks a
                  quality anti-malware security application.<br><br>
                  Malicious apps can hide in seemingly legitimate applications,
                  especially when they are downloaded from websites or direct links
                  (in an email, text, or chat message) instead of an official app store.
                  Here it’s important to look at the warning messages when installing
                  applications, especially if they seek permission to access your email
                  or other personal information.<br><br>
                  Bottom line, it’s best to stick to trusted sources for mobile apps,
                  only installing reputable third-party apps, and always downloading
                  those apps directly from the vendor—and never from any other site.
                  All in all, there is a world of bad actors out there, throwing tainted
                  bait at you with an offer for an Internet accelerator, new download
                  manager, hard disk drive cleaner, or an alternative web search service.
                  Malware attacks would not work without the most important ingredient:
                  you. That is, a gullible version of you, willing to open up an email
                  attachment you don’t recognize, or to click and install something from
                  an untrustworthy source. And don’t take this as “click-shaming,”
                  because even very experienced people have been tricked into installing
                  malware.<br><br>
                  Even if you install something from a credible source,
                  if you don’t pay attention to the permission request to install
                  other bundled software at the same time, you could be installing
                  software you don’t want. This extra software, also known as a
                  potentially unwanted program (PUP), is often presented as a necessary
                  component, but it often isn’t.<br><br>
                  Another wrinkle is a bit of social engineering that a Malwarebytes
                  expert observed in the UK. The scam hit mobile users by taking
                  dvantage of a common mobile direct-to-bill payment option. Users
                  visited mobile sites, unwittingly tripping invisible buttons that
                  charge them via their mobile numbers, directly billing the victims’
                  networks, which pass the cost onto their bill. <br><br>
                  To be fair, we should also include a blameless malware infection
                  scenario. Because it’s even possible that just visiting a malicious
                  website and viewing an infected page and/or banner ad will result in
                  a drive-by malware download. Malware distributed via bad ads on
                  legitimate websites is known as malvertising.
                  On the other hand, if you’re not running an adequate security
                  program, the malware infection and its aftermath are still on you.

                    <h1 class="subsubtitle"> <i> <u>The history of malware</u></i></h1>

                    <p class="text2">
                     The 1980s and onward: The theoretical underpinning of “self-reproducing automata”
                     (i.e., viruses) dates back to a lecture delivered in 1949 by 20th century Renaissance
                     man John von Neumann. However, the history of modern viruses begins with a program
                     called Elk Cloner, which started infecting Apple II systems in 1982. Disseminated by
                     infected floppy disks, the virus itself was harmless, but it spread to all disks attached
                     to a system, exploding so virulently that it can be considered the first large-scale
                     computer virus outbreak in history. Note that this was prior to any Windows PC malware.
                     Since then, viruses and worms have become widespread.<br><br>

                     The 1990s: Microsoft Windows began its long run as the most popular OS in the world
                     (not to be overtaken till Google’s Android many years later). As the Windows OS and
                     its built-in applications grew in popularity, so too did the number of viruses written
                     for the platform. In particular, malware authors started to write infectious code in the
                     macro language of Microsoft Word. These macro viruses infected documents and templates
                     rather than executable applications, although strictly speaking, the Word document macros
                     are a form of executable code.<br><br>

                     2002 to 2007: Instant messaging (IM) worms spread across popular IM networks, including AOL AIM,
                     MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger. Most attacks started with a social engineering ploy. Attackers
                     might send out an IM that reads something like “Who’s with you in this picture?” or “OMG, I think
                     you won the lottery!” along with a link to a malicious download. Once your system was infected, the
                     IM worm would further propagate itself by sending malicious download links to everyone on your contact list.<br><br>

                     2005 to 2009: Adware attacks proliferated, presenting unwanted advertisements to computer screens,
                     sometimes in the form of a pop-up or in a window that users could not close. These ads often exploited
                     legitimate software as a means to spread, but around 2008, software publishers began suing adware companies
                     for fraud. The result was millions of dollars in fines. This eventually drove adware companies to shut down.
                     Today’s tech support scams owe much to the adware of yesteryear, employing many of the same tricks as the old
                     adware attacks; e.g., full screen ads that can’t be closed or exited.<br><br>

                     2007 to 2009: Malware scammers turned to social networks such as Myspace as a channel for delivering rogue
                     advertisements, links to phishing pages, and malicious applications. After Myspace declined in popularity,
                     Facebook and Twitter became the preferred platforms.<br><br>

                     2013: A new form of malware called ransomware launched an attack under the name CryptoLocker, which continued
                     from early September 2013 to late May 2014, targeting computers running Windows. CryptoLocker succeeded in
                     forcing victims to pay about $3 million in total, BBC News reported. Moreover, the ransomware’s success gave
                     rise to an unending series of copycats.<br><br>
                     2013 to 2017: Delivered through Trojans, exploits, and malvertising, ransomware became the king of malware,
                     culminating in huge outbreaks in 2017 that affected businesses of all kinds.
                     2017: Cryptocurrency—and how to mine for it—has captured widespread attention, leading to a new malware scam
                     called cryptojacking, or the act of secretly using someone else’s device to surreptitiously mine for cryptocurrency
                     with the victims’ resources.<br><br>

                     2018 to 2019: Ransomware made its big comeback. This time, however, cybercriminals shifted their focus from individual
                     consumers to business targets. Riding a wave of GandCrab and Ryuk ransomware infections, attacks on businesses went up
                     365 percent from 2018 to 2019. As of this writing, there’s no indication the ransomware attacks will slow down.<br><br>
