            Through this experience, I learned the importance and the challenges of working
            in a large group. We have finished over 100 pages in a short increment of time but it was
            undeniably very challenging to keep the whole team coordinated and connected over
            the last month. However, it was indeed a great opportunity to obtain real-life experience
            as a developer.

                    Making and designing those pages took me lots of time, but it worth it all.
                    <br>
                    At first glance, my knowledges about these topics where not satisfying, but then thanks to all the work done
                    I have to admit I feel more confident about them.
                    Working with all the group and spending so much time together has been a pleasure and I am proud of the final result.

                        Was the work done worth doing?<br>
                        We did it, and as a topic leader I am satisfied about what we accomplished as a team.<br>

                        No, and never will. As a matter of fact, analysing the history of computer threads and the progessive aggressive behaviour and evolution of malware and comouter viruses in all their forms,
                        security is now and for all the days to come the most critical topic of all, where information and solutions will never be enough.<br>

                        This project allowed me to improve my skills with html and above all with git that I didn't understand very well how it worked, but now, after having used it for a few weeks I can say that I know how to use git well enough.

                        I really enjoyed this project so much it made me discover many html things that I had not used yet and it made me discover many others that I have not used in this project but that will be useful in the future.

                        I was also happy to work with the group that had precise and organized leaders so as to be able to carry out the project in the best possible way to have just met and have just started this training path.

                            am fascinated by all things cyber security. Before taking on this role, I supported 11 princes,
                            invested in 5 valid, non-pyramid scheme businesses and had 7 different anti-virus softwares that
                            clean my pc every day. I am pretty sure my pc mined Bitcoin when i was asleep and whenever I booted it up I
                            had to pay ransom for every file on there.

My effort in this project consisted into research the 4 proposed topics, developing them and creating different Html pages to expose and explain every concept in the most readable and user-friendly way. It was part of my goal to explain the history, functioning and consequences of every important milestone in the virus history that I needed to analyse.
Moreover, I put much effort into presenting every concept on a clear and minimal Html page to help the reader better understand and raise awareness about the Virus’s risks.
I worked synchronically with the Team Leader and all the other group members and I’m glad of this workgroup experience and the final result achieved.

                                 This is Carson, accompanied by a official name hard to pronounce Chengjiang. I took care of 7 pages in total about the Adware, Spyware, Malware, Trickbot, DDoS, Spam, Emotet. Doing research about these topic allowed me get a better understanding of them. Working with my teammates was a extremely pleasant business. Thanks everyone paid effort to this project, especially Hun and Kyla who well organized the all team to work together and my topic leader Martin who helped me to deal with the git stuff.

                                  I had to do a lot of researches to find out information about these topics so I could gather
                                  the knowledge into simple pages where everything is explained in the clearest possible way.
                                  By doing so I dived into new aspects of the IT world facing concepts I've never encountered before.

                                                I took care of rootkits (malware section), polymorphic viruses and resudent viruses (computer virus section).
                                                It was interesting researching such topics, it is safe to assume that it has broadened my knowledge
                                                on viruses and malwares. <br><br>
                                                I also took care of both bonuses, first and second. The most difficult part, was trying to keep
                                                the paths resolved while traversing pages interlinked with each other. Some solutions i came up with
                                                are everything but elegant, but it works.(does it?)
                                                I also helped in coming up with a JS script to handle the search bar.
                                                I truly enjoyed working alongside my team members.
