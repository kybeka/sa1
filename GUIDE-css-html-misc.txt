Mainly, you'll be using the files named "article_template.html", which are the
templates used for writing your articles, based on the group you're part of;

The way you'll use them is by copying and pasting the file into the "html"
folder, and renaming it according to your article name;
Once you've done that, give a look at the template given; try changing some of
the filler we put in (Lorem Ipsum, Title, Subtitle,...), and the Images;
remember: each template is slightly different according to your subject.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
  for any suggestions, I've created a CSS-TODO-and-SUGGESTION
  file, where you can put any suggestion that comes to mind

---Ids and classes:-------------------------------------------------------------
~~~navigation bar:
  It will be rare that you have to change stuff in the navigation bar, but this
  should help to get around.
  #sidebar:
    the sidebar on the left, which slides to the right on hover, and shows a list;
    that list is supposed to be containing internals anchors to the page (either
    individuals articles )

  .dropdown:
    the dropdowns bar with links to the sub-sections

  #main:
    the main content of the page, where all the article(s) and article related
    content will be

~~~article:
  The articles are organized in a table, where there is a title, a text
  paragraph and space for an image on each row:
  .imghead, .imghead2:
    main containers for each combination of text containers (title header and
    paragraph); different widths

  .title:
    title of the article/article section

  <img>:
    tag for the image(s) relative to the article(s)

  .subtitle:
    subtitle for an article section

  .subsubtitle:
    subtitle for an article subsection

  .text, .text2:
    text paragraphs the article's content

~~~footer
  The footer is organized to show information about the current page, and a link
  to the following ones; here you'll have to edit the "Chapter n", the "Name
  Surname", "href" and title of the .arrow link.
  NOTE: if the footer table doesn't have a .footer class, please add it in
  (forgot to put it in), as it will allow us to make small changes on its style
  as needed.

  .footer:
    footer for the page; contains info regarding the author

---images and custom CSS--------------------------------------------------------
~~~images:
  You'll probably want to put your own images on your page; to do that, create
  a sub-folder named the same as your page. This will allow a clear structure
  for the webiste, as well as easy traceability in case of problems.

~~~css and custom main proprieties:
  You already have a general purpose stylesheet, but maybe you also want some
  particular style, or maybe elements that we didn't cover; if so, you can
  implement them yourself; Create a css file in the css folder of your topic,
  and name it as your html file. This way, you'll allow also other to take
  advantage of your newly created style.

  ++color and background-color:
    when you want to access the main colors (black and white), DON'T write them
    like this:
      color:            white;  #fff;   rgb(255,255,255);   ...
      background-color: black;  #000;   rgb(0,0,0);         ...
    BUT DO write them like this:
      color: inherit
      color: var(--second-cl)

      background-color: inherit; (parent color);
      background-color: var(--main-cl);

    This allows to change 1 time the color in the root of the page, and have it
    cascade down to all elements as needed, especially with javascript;
    NOTE: the repetition of the proprieties is needed in case the custom css
    variables are not supported;
    Also, instead of declaring the colors, we can just inherit them from the
    parents elements, which allows for more consistency, even if we change the
    colors;

---JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvascript--------------------------------------------
    This is the part I'm most proud about: the javascript functions you can use
    to customize proprieties and behaviors of your web page;

    HOW TO USE them:
      html elements can trigger certain events, like onclick, onhover,...
      (SEE https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp)

      the way you can use these events is  with the following syntax:
        <button id="btn" onclick="func(arg1, arg2, arg3,...)"></button>
      Once clicked, the element "button" will call the function "func", with
      argouments "arg1", "arg2", and so on;


    FUNCTION toggleStyle(elid, prop, defStyle, secondStyle):
      this functions allows you to toggle between 2 style on a certain element;
      - "elid": string which allows you to select which element (if it has an
        id) to apply the proprieties to;
      - "prop": string which selects which propriety to change (either if it
        exists already or not)
      - defStyle: string which defines the default style of the element; this is
        the style to which it will return after the second toggle;
      - secondStyle: string which defines the second style of the element; this
        is the style to which it will toggle at firs;
      WARNING: this can be used only 1 time par element


    FUNCTION setStyle(elid, prop, style):
      - "elid": string which allows you to select which element (if it has an
        id) to apply the proprieties to;
      - "prop": string which selects which propriety to change (either if it
        exists already or not);
      - "style": string of target style to change the element to;

    FUNCTION toggleRoot(elid, prop, defstyle, secStyle):
      this function allows you to change root proprietis of the webpage, using
      a checkbox (required)
      - "elid": string of the id of the checkbox, which will trigger the
        function
      - "prop": string which selects which of the proprieties to change;
      - "defStyle": string which selects the default propriety. This is the
        propriety it will fall back to on the second click;
      - "secStyle": secondary style, which will be selected on the first click;
